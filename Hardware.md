## Thoughts:
* Purposes are for internet browsing, coding (VS Code), and gaming (LoL, Valorant, Overwatch). As you can tell, nothing crazy - no editing, VR, or 3D shenanigans. 
* Thought about building a desktop, but decided to go pre-built because of a quick need. Chose NZXT BLD - received with GPU display ports covered by the case, which I had to self-adjust. Otherwise, I'm 100% happy with the setup for what I need.

## Wishlist:
* Single Ultrawide Monitor (with monitor arm?) to transition from current dual (27 + 24 Vert). Maybe a 34"?
* Desk - thinking of a janky Ikea LINNMON + ALEX + some way to keep pc off desk and ground
* Chair - anything that doesn't hurt hips tbh
